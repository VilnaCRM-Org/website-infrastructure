## Possibilities

- Modern stack for infrastructure: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Terraspace - terraform framework](https://terraspace.cloud/)
- Built-in docker environment and convenient `make` cli command
- A lot of CI checks to ensure the highest code quality that can be ([Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/), [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/), Security checks, Code style fixer)
- Configured testing tool - [Terraform compliance](https://terraform-compliance.com/)
- A command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format - [Hurl](https://hurl.dev)

## Infrastructure

Here you can get acquainted with our infrastructure for frontend and CD pipeline for terraform!

Used AWS Services: Chatbot, Cloudwatch, S3, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeStar, KMS, IAM, DNS, Cloudfront, SNS, Lambda.

## Installation

### AWS Credentials
---

For using this repository we recommend to use different AWS accounts. One for your production version, second for testing changes in infrastructure. Also it can be as many as you want. You will need just to create another tfvars variables file.

Let`s move tp the installation.

#### AWS Console
---
After creating your account you should do the following steps:

1. **Create CodeStar Connection:**

   Search -> Codepipeline -> Settings -> Connections -> Create connection -> Choose Github -> Enter Connection Name -> Install a new app -> Choose your account -> Authenticate -> Choose your app from Gihub Apps -> Connect.

   Recommended connection name: "**Github**", otherwise you will need change in `tfvars`.

2. **Connect your Slack workspace to AWS Chatbot:**

   Search -> AWS Chatbot -> Configure a chat client -> Chat Client(Slack) -> Configure Client.

   After, it will redirect you to your workspace where you will need to allow AWS Chatbot to use your workspace.

3. **Create IAM user for terraform:**

   Search -> IAM -> Users -> Create user -> Enter User Name -> Next -> Attach policies directly -> Check AdministratorAccess -> Create user

   After creation of user:

   Press on user you just created -> Go to Security credentials -> Create access key -> Choose  code -> Check Confirmation mark -> Next -> Enter description value -> Create access key -> Save the Access key and Secret access key credentials

**Save them, you will need it later.**

Also you will need your own domain.

#### AWS Domain
---
[Register or transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html) your domain to the Route53.

You can read [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-migrate-external-domain-dns-service-aws-route-53-harry-singh/) if you have troubles with transferring domain.(Optional - [validate domain ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/domain-ownership-validation.html))

#### Slack Notifications
---
If you don\`t need Slack Notification, just set `create_slack_notification` in `tvars/base.tfvars` to `false`. variable to false and skip this step.

**Otherwise,** you will need Workspace ID and Channel ID`s from your Slack.

Channels that you will need: 
- Deployments Notification Channel.
- Reports Channel.
- CI/CD Alerts Channel.
- Website Alerts Channel.

To get them you need:

1. Launch your internet browser and log into your Slack account.

2. Once you're signed in, navigate to your primary workspace page and find the URL in the top search bar.

**The URL should follow this format: https://app.slack.com/client/T111111L222/C3333333ZPF**

The string of letters and numbers beginning with **"T"** is your workspace ID.

The string of letters and numbers beginning with **"C"** is your channel ID.(Also you can get it in the channel details).

**Save them for later.**

### Local machine software requirements

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), [Ruby](https://terraspace.cloud/docs/install/ruby/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine. 
You need to use the latest [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and set up the project locally using this OS. Follow the guides specified in the links.

Necessary Terraform Version for the Terraspace is 1.4.7.
Please, follow this links to install  [Terraform](https://terraspace.cloud/docs/install/terraform/) and [Terraspace](https://terraspace.cloud/docs/install/gem/) to install it.

Or you can use `make install-terraspace`.

Also you need to set up the connection to your AWS Account. With the credentials you got before use `aws configure`.

```bash
$aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Your Access Key Here>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Your Secret Key Here>
Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
Default output format [None]:
```

In case you are using any other region, please respecify it in the `tfvars`. Also specify your own domain name in the `tfvars`.

After you can move to the next step.

### Environmental variables 

Also before running you need to set up some local variables:
- **TF_VAR_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ID** - ID of your Slack workspace.
- **TF_VAR_CODEPIPELINE_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID** - ID of Slack channel where the deployments notification will be posted.
- **TF_VAR_WEBSITE_ALERTS_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID** - ID of Slack channel where the CodePipeline alerts will be posted.
- **TF_VAR_WEBSITE_ALERTS_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID** - ID of Slack channel where the Website alerts will be posted.
- **TF_VAR_REPORT_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID** - ID of Slack channel where the reports of the website tests will be posted.
- **GITHUB_OWNER** - Owner of the repositories. Default: `VilnaCRM-Org`.
- **GITHUB_TOKEN** - Token that will be used to configure Github Provider in Terraform.
- **TF_VAR_GITHUB_TOKEN** - Token that will be used in CodePipelines to create/recreate infrastructure etc.

Note: if you are not using Slack Notifications, skip those variables.

### Bringing up the infrastucture

After you configured everything you can deploy infrastructure by running such commands in order.
- `make terraspace-all-init`
- `make terraspace-all-validate`
- `make terraspace-all-up`

After you deployed you can create the website infrastructure itself using.
- `terraspace all up`

### Instructions on how to set up and run the changes in AWS

CLI Instructions:
Once you have made the changes, you can run the pipeline using the `make` capabilities. If you already have the infrastructure, don't forget to apply the changes before running the pipeline.

> make trigger-pipeline

Run the command for each pipeline specifying its name, see the list of `make` possibilities for details on how to properly run this trigger


AWS Management Console Instructions:
Before running, make sure you have applied the changes made earlier.

Search -> Codepipeline -> Pipelines -> Select a pipeline using the checkbox on the left -> Release change -> Release 

Follow these steps for each pipeline. 

## Using make

You can use `make` command to easily control and work with project locally.

> make install

This command installs all that you need to start working with Terraspace framework.

Execute `make` or `make help` to see the full list of project commands.
