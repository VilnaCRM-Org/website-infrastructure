Used AWS Services: Chatbot, Cloudwatch, S3, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeStar, KMS, IAM, DNS, Cloudfront, SNS, Lambda.

## Installation

### AWS Credentials

For using this repository we recommend to use different AWS accounts. One for your production version, second for testing changes in infrastructure. Also it can be as many as you want. You will need just to create another tfvars variables file.

#### AWS Console

After creating your account you should do the following steps:

1. **Create CodeStar Connection:**

   Search -> Codepipeline -> Settings -> Connections -> Create connection -> Choose Github -> Enter Connection Name -> Install a new app -> Choose your account -> Authenticate -> Choose your app from Gihub Apps -> Connect.

   Recommended connection name: "**Github**", otherwise you will need change in tfvars.

2. **Connect your Slack workspace to AWS Chatbot:**

   Search -> AWS Chatbot -> Configure a chat client -> Chat Client(Slack) -> Configure Client.

   After, it will redirect you to your workspace where you will need to allow AWS Chatbot to use your workspace.

3. **Create IAM user for terraform:**

   Search -> IAM -> Users -> Create user -> Enter User Name -> Next -> Attach policies directly -> Check AdministratorAccess -> Create user

   After creation of user:

   Press on user you just created -> Go to Security credentials -> Create access key -> Choose Local code -> Check Confirmation mark -> Next -> Enter description value -> Create access key -> Save the Access key and Secret access key credentials

**Save them, you will need it later.**

Also you will need your own domain.

#### AWS Domain

[Register or transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html) your domain to the Route53.

You can read [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-migrate-external-domain-dns-service-aws-route-53-harry-singh/) if you have troubles with transferring domain.(Optional - [validate domain ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/domain-ownership-validation.html))

#### Slack Notifications

If you don\`t need Slack Notification, just set `create_slack_notification` variable to false and skip this step.

**Otherwise,** you will need Workspace ID and Channel ID`s from your Slack.

To get them you need:

1. Launch your internet browser and log into your Slack account.

2. Once you're signed in, navigate to your primary workspace page and find the URL in the top search bar.

**The URL should follow this format: https://app.slack.com/client/T111111L222/C3333333ZPF**

The string of letters and numbers beginning with **"T"** is your workspace ID.

The string of letters and numbers beginning with **"C"** is your channel ID.(Also you can get it in the channel details).

**Save them for later.**

### Local machine

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), [Ruby](https://terraspace.cloud/docs/install/ruby/), [Terraspace](https://terraspace.cloud/docs/install/gem/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine. Follow the guides specified in the links.
