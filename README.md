# Infrastructure template for modern DevOps applications

## Possibilities
- Modern stack for services: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Terraspace](https://terraspace.cloud/)
- Built-in docker environment and convenient `make` cli command
- A lot of CI checks to ensure the highest code quality that can be ([checkov](https://www.checkov.io/), [infracost](https://www.infracost.io/), [inframap](https://github.com/cycloidio/inframap), [terrascan](https://runterrascan.io/) and other terraform related checks)
- Configured testing tools
- Much more!

## Why you might need it
Many DevOps engineers need to create new projects from scratch and spend a lot of time.

We decided to simplify this exhausting process and create a public template for modern infrastructures. This template is used for all our microservices in VilnaCRM.
